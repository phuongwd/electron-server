# Chestnut üå∞

![tests](https://github.com/stashpad/chestnut/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

> Chestnut is a lightweight server for deploying Electron apps. With the click of a button, you can deploy to [Render](https://render.com) to provide downloads and automatic updates for your users. Chestnut is an evolution of the popular [Hazel](https://github.com/vercel/hazel) server from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

- Built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and Typescript.
- Caches release files (for private repos) & metadata from [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) on disk.
- Refreshes the cache every 10 minutes ([configurable](https://github.com/stashpad/chestnut#congfiguration)).
- Supports macOS, Windows, and Linux (via `.AppImage`).
- Works with Electron's built in `autoUpdater`, or `electron-updater`'s version (provided by `electron-builder`).
- Supports both public and private GitHub repos.

## Why use Chestnut instead of Hazel?

- File caching support for private repos. While this means using more bandwidth, it allows you to use a private repository on GitHub to store your releases without hitting your GitHub token's rate limit.
- Supports both Electron updater systems (both Electron's built in `autoUpdater` and the `electron-updater` that comes with `electron-builder`)
- You can easily provide automatic updates on macOS (with `.dmg`), Windows (using the `NSIS` `.exe` target), and Linux (via `.AppImage`)
- Security updates. Hazel is [no longer receiving updates](https://github.com/vercel/hazel/issues/62#issuecomment-1159562487) so important security fixes may not be applied. Chestnut is created and maintained by [Stashpad](https://www.stashpad.com?utm_source=chestnut).

## Usage üì¶

You can easily deploy Chestnut to [Render](https://render.com) with a single click. Don't forget to [configure](https://github.com/stashpad/chestnut#congfiguration) your [ENV variables](https://render.com/docs/environment-variables) on Render.

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/stashpad/chestnut/tree/main)

Once it is deployed, set up your Electron app to work with the Chestnut deployment.

```ts
const { app, autoUpdater } = require('electron')

const server = '<deployment-url>' // Ex. https://releases.stashpad.com
const url = `${server}/update/${process.platform}/${app.getVersion()}`

autoUpdater.setFeedURL({ url })

setInterval(() => {
  autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()
}, 10 * 60 * 1000) // every 10 mins
```

You're all set! ‚úÖ

The `autoUpdater` will ask your Chestnut deployment for updates.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Chestnut can be easily configured using a few environment variables.

Required:

- `ACCOUNT`: The github user/organization name. (Ex. `stashpad`)
- `REPOSITORY`: The github repo name. (Ex. `desktop`)

Optional:

- `PORT`: The port that Chestnut should use (defaults to 3000)
- `INTERVAL`: Refreshes the cache every `INTERVAL` minutes (defaults to 10)

For private repos:

- `TOKEN`: Your GitHub token with the `repo` scope
- `PASSWORD`: Used to bust the file cache and force a reload of the latest release. Please choose a secure password since busting the cache will use up your GitHub Token's request limit.
- `URL`: The server's URL

## Usage with Electron's `autoUpdater`

An example of how to use Chestnut with Electron's built in `autoUpdater`.

```ts
const { app, autoUpdater } = require('electron')

const server = '<deployment-url>' // Ex. https://releases.stashpad.com
const url = `${server}/update/${process.platform}/${app.getVersion()}`

autoUpdater.setFeedURL({ url })
```

## Usage with `electron-updater`

An example of how to use Chestnut with `electron-updater`'s `autoUpdater`, provided by the `electron-builder` library. It consumes the files from the GitHub Release, checking the `latest.yml` family of files to know when an update is available.

```ts
const { autoUpdater } = require('electron-updater')
const server = '<deployment-url>/files' // Ex. https://releases.stashpad.com/files

autoUpdater.setFeedURL({ provider: 'generic', url: server })
```

## Routes

### /

Displays an overview page showing the repository information as well as available platforms (and file sizes). Provides links to the repo, releases, current version, and direct download links for each platform.

### /download

Detects the platform of the visitor (via the user agent header) and downloads the correct package for the platform.

If the latest version can't be found in GitHub Releases, or if the platform is not supported, it will return a `404 Not Found`.

### /download/:platform

Accepts a platform (such as `mac`, `mac_arm64`, `windows`, etc.) to download a specific package. Common aliases like `darwin`, and `win32` are supported.

Here is a list of platforms and their common aliases.

```ts
darwin: ["mac", "macos", "osx"],
exe: ["win32", "windows", "win"],
deb: ["debian"],
rpm: ["fedora"],
AppImage: ["appimage", "linux"],
dmg: ["dmg"],
```

To programatically get the platform in your app's code, you can use `process.platform` or `os.platform()` provided by `node`.

If the platform does not exist for the current release, it will return a `404 Not Found`.

### /update/:platform/:version

Check if there is an update available based on the `:version` parameter. It is passed by the `autoUpdater`, and provides some metadata about the new version as well as a `url` to use for downloading it.

If there is no release available, it will return a `204 No Content`.

### /files/:filename

For use with `electron-updater` and `electron-builder`. Returns the files exactly as provided by the `electron-builder` lib in the release.

For example, the auto updater will request `/files/latest-mac.yml` to know if an update is available for macOS. The `latest-*.yml` files are generated by the `electron-builder` library and should be included in the GitHub Release. Similarly it will return a download of any distributable like `/files/YourApp-1.0.0.exe`.

### /refresh/:password

Checks GitHub for the latest release and forces all files to be cached, bypassing the cache interval. Use this route with the `PASSWORD` provided as an environment variable. If there is no `PASSWORD` environment variable specified then the route will do nothing and return a `200 OK`.

For GitHub releases stored in a private repo, this consumes a request on your GitHub token's rate limit to check on the latest release.

## Credits

Chestnut is an evolution of the popular [Hazel](https://github.com/vercel/hazel) server from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Much of the code was brought directly from Hazel. Thank you to the creators of Hazel for their previous work üí™.

The name Chestnut is inspired by the [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel) updater used to update Electron apps on both the macOS and Windows platforms.

Here at Stashpad, we found that nothing quite fit our needs for deploying our Stashpad [desktop app](https://www.stashpad.com?utm_source=chestnut) - so we built Chestnut. We hope it can help you too!
